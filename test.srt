1
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,470
Yoshino!

2
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,360
I'm taking Aika home.

3
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,620
Just don't skip class.

4
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,360
You won't have enough credits to pass if you miss one more.

5
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,620
It'll work out.

6
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:34,970
Later.

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:35,670
Yeah.

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,820
See you around, Aika-chan.

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,770
Couldn't you at least give him the time of day?

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,670
Mind your own business, Mahiro.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,510
I don't get why you hate him so much.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,140
Like, he might not be a good guy, but he's not that bad.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,890
He's just a con artist pretending to be a nice guy.

14
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,330
The kind of guy who could lie with a straight face.

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,550
That's harsh.

16
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,200

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,490

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,040
<i>The time is out of joint;</i>

19
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,510
<i>O, cursed spite...</i>

20
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,890
<i>That ever I was born to set it right!</i>

21
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,260
Episode 1
The Mage

22
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,260
The Mage

23
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,260
in the Barrel
The Mage

24
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,260
The Mage
in the Barrel

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,570
Damn it, Samon. This was your plan?

26
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,640
Bravo.

27
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,160
Now I'm stranded on an island

28
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,770
with some cheap sandals and a sundress.

29
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,090
I guess it's better than being stuck here

30
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,040
with nothing but my underwear.

31
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,340
But I can't even use magic in this state...

32
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,080
Master Samon.

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,840
Is this really enough to stop the princess?

34
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,510
On this island,

35
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,840
she won't be able to acquire the offerings she needs to use magic.

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,300
As such, the princess is no different than an ordinary girl.

37
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,740
So the princess...

38
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,800
Yes, she will perish on that island.

39
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,390
<i>That's Samon for you.</i>

40
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,790
He probably put up a barrier to make the island invisible, too.

41
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,360
I won't be able to seek help from outside.

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,460
Guess I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere.

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,280
Look here, Samon! You better watch your back!

44
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,150
I'm Kusaribe Hakaze,

45
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,890
the strongest mage ever born into our clan!

46
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,960
I'll put an end to your ambitions—

47
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,480
Guess I should gather some food first...

48
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,290
<i>The Defense Force's held a large-scale drill recently,</i>

49
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,560

Eat all your celery, too!

Promise to do it.

51
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,570
<i>The Ministry of Defense made a statement on the drill,</i>

52
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,070

53
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,200

Rumors Around Town

59
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,400
<i>How much weight does a simple promise carry?</i>

60
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,230
Hey, do you think Yoshino's cute?

61
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,310
I guess...

62
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,210
But without Mahiro around, he's just another guy.

63
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,120
He's so fine. Why don't you go for it?

64
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,610
I heard a rumor that he has a girlfriend...

65
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,510
I do.

66
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,130
Huh?

67
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,000
Was he talking to us?

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,160
Who does he think he is?

69
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,640
Does he think he's better than us?

70
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Takigawa,

71
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,390
have you heard anything from Fuwa?

72
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,000
It's been a month already.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,090
True.

74
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,170
Well, if he isn't dead, he must be out there somewhere.

75
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
How can you say that?

76
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,350
I guess if it's his old friend talking that way, he must be all right.

77
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,170
But he disappeared without even notifying the school.

78
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,140
And it is Fuwa...

79
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,030
He seems like the kind who'd cause enough trouble to make the papers.

80
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,220
You're right.

81
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,170
What?

82
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,550
<i>If he's alive, he'd probably be killing someone right about now.</i>

83
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,170
<i>If promises carry weight...</i>

84
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,770
Yoshino!

85
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,820
All by yourself, eh?

86
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,530
<i>This just isn't my day.</i>

87
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,990
<i>Five, huh?</i>

88
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,040
Feels pretty light.

89
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,620
How much is in there?

90
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,760
He's got quite a bit.

91
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,710
Let's hit the arcade, then.

92
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,250
Again?
<i>I can't do it.</i>

93
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,440
<i>I can't take on five guys at once.</i>

94
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,440
<i>But...</i>

95
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,510
<i>But if Mahiro was here...</i>

96
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,680
Fifteen in a row?

97
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,190
Even a child would know to run away.

98
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,320
Fights aren't about numbers...

99
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,010
Besides, Yoshino was with me.

100
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,730
Even though we were surrounded, it was easy.

101
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,030
So in other words, this is all Yoshino-san's fault.

102
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,910
What? I'm the victim here!

103
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,640
I was dragged into Mahiro's mess, so—

104
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,040
Then you should have fled alone.

105
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,690
I couldn't just abandon Mahiro—

106
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,500
Are you stupid?

107
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,400
Not even Mahiro is stupid enough to sit there and take all those guys on alone.

108
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,200
Acting like a victim makes you look even worse.

109
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,010
Hey, now...

110
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,670
Everyone says it.

111
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,850
If not for Takigawa Yoshino,

112
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,850
the police would've killed or arrested Fuwa Mahiro by now.

113
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,730
And it's your responsibility.

114
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,250
This is all your fault.

115
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,770
<i>Hey, Mahiro...</i>

116
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:31,290
<i>Acquiring what you want isn't just difficult...</i>

117
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,970
<i>It's also trivial.</i>

118
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,750
<i>Even if you got what you want,</i>

119
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,210
<i>it wouldn't make you happy.</i>

120
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,270
Are you Fuwa Mahiro?

121
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,270
Mahiro again?

122
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,880
Excuse me, I am Evangeline Yamamoto.

123
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,530
My friends call me Fräulein Yamamoto.

124
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,860
Unemployed, twenty-eight years old.

125
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,250
I'm not a shady character.

126
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,220
Everything about you is shady.

127
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,620
And what's your profile?

128
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,920
Takigawa Yoshino, a sophomore.

129
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,560
What's your relationship to Fuwa Mahiro?

130
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,300
He and I go way back.

131
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,670
And that's enough for you to visit his family's plot?

132
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,710
Have you heard from Mahiro recently?

133
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,520
Not a word since he disappeared a month ago.

134
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,850
Really?

135
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,100
Really...

136
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,070
Sorry, but this is important.

137
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,530
<i>A gun suddenly shoved in my face...</i>

138
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,200
<i>This is totally surreal.</i>

139
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,140
<i>But...</i>

140
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,880
<i>But...</i>

141
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,540
Two weeks ago,

142
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,420
a young man in his late teens was seen in a certain area.

143
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,040
One week ago,

144
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,890
an individual thought to be the same boy was seen elsewhere.

145
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,300
Both areas are now under quarantine and entrance is strictly prohibited.

146
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,310
Hold on...

147
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,600
The news never mentioned that—

148
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,580
In the second area,

149
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,290
the boy saved someone's life.

150
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,880
When asked his name, the boy called himself

151
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,770
Fuwa Mahiro.

152
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,830
I don't understand anything you're saying...

153
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,440
He really isn't the type to rescue somebody.

154
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,780
That's a terrible thing to say about a friend.

155
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,240
He's a pretty terrible person.

156
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,740
Even when dealing with a beautiful girl?

157
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,460
Say, around fifteen years old?

158
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,290
No, he might've saved her.

159
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,840
Does she sound like his type?

160
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,010
Mahiro had a little sister.

161
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,560
If he saw someone who looked like her, he wouldn't've been able to leave.

162
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,670
He treasured Aika-chan more than anything.

163
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,280
Treasured?

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,280
Past tense?

165
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,640
She now rests under that gravestone.

166
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,120
Yoshino, why did Aika have to die?

167
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,080
It's probably like the police said.

168
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,480
Someone broke in, looking for money—

169
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,610
You know what I mean.

170
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,360
Until that day, Aika lived a normal life.

171
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,930
Why did she have to die this way?

172
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,210
And the killer even got away.

173
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,550
We still don't know that for sure.

174
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,950
It's been ten months and they don't have any leads.

175
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,980
Nothing left behind...

176
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,280
No witnesses...

177
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,750
They don't even know if the killer was acting alone.

178
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,620
We just don't know.

179
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,160
The task force hardly does anything anymore.

180
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,400
There's no chance that the case will move forward.

181
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,490
It's absurd!

182
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,510
It doesn't make sense...

183
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,830
Isn't absurdity part of the human condition?

184
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,710
You don't even give a shit, do you?

185
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,960
Well, I guess Aika never did like you...

186
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,640
So, how would you handle such absurdity?

187
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,710
Find her killer and punish them yourself?

188
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,210
Yeah, that's it...

189
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,520
I'll do whatever it takes for everything to make sense again!

190
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,110
I understand.

191
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,240
You really don't know anything?

192
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,000
<i>What should I do?</i>

193
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,960
A butterfly.

194
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,210
What?

195
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,150
Nothing, a swallowtail butterfly just flew by...

196
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,550
What of it?!

197
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,880
Swallowtails spend winter in cocoons.

198
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,340
It's snowing...

199
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,010
A single butterfly could just be an anomaly—

200
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,750
That's impossible...

201
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,370
Unfortunately for you,

202
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,960
I have more than one gun.

203
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,520
Who the hell is this defiling my sister's grave?

204
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Mahiro...

205
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,160
Mahiro, where did you come from?

206
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,360
Over there.

207
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,590
Over there...

208
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,120
I flew here.

209
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,730
Huh?

210
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,120
Anyway, who the hell is this?

211
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,130
Twenty-eight and unemployed, she's Fräulein Yamamoto-san.

212
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,080
Are you kidding me?

213
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,290
I doubt Yamamoto would want to hear that from some flying kid.

214
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,880
I just followed these guys.

215
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:16,930
Mahiro!

216
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,480
What was your plan if that had hit me?

217
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,230
So, Fuwa Mahiro, you really did meet with a mage.

218
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,720
A mage?

219
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,940
Do you work for the government?

220
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,670
Unfortunately, I'm just a volunteer.

221
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,560
Do you think bureaucrats and politicians believe in magic?

222
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,630
Answer me!

223
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,380
What is your connection to the black iron syndrome?

224
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,790
At this rate, Japan will—

225
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,870
What's your problem?

226
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,060
Not even at point-blank range?!

227
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,610
I like your spirit...

228
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,070
But for now, rest a while.

229
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,450
Well, let's go.

230
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,920
Was there something you wanted to say?

231
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,920
There's so much I want to say, I have no idea where to start.

232
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,930
Then keep your mouth shut.

233
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,060
Hey...

234
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,590
Wait, Mahiro!

235
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,920
Hey!

236
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,830
This city is done for.

237
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,230
Are you okay?

238
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,360
Leave him.

239
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,440
He's already beginning to metallicize.

240
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,230
What? Metallicize?

241
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,400
It's the syndrome she was talking about.

242
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,170
The black iron syndrome...

243
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,520
Like a statue...

244
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,830
The black iron syndrome...

245
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,510
It's a psychic phenomenon that turns all organic life into metal.

246
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,150
It's not a real illness,

247
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,370
but it looks like some kind of horrible, infectious disease.

248
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,700
The same thing already happened in three or so regions.

249
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,430
The government's doing what they can to hide it, but they won't be able to forever.

250
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,310
They'll think up some reason to quarantine this area, too.

251
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,720
Then those barricades she was talking about...

252
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,580
Will we be okay?!

253
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,700
Yeah.

254
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,900
When the syndrome's effects hit their peak, you were with me.

255
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,290
Did she do that to you?

256
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,230
No, it was some seniors...

257
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,830
That isn't important right now!

258
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,060
Those guys again? They never learn.

259
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,440
Tell me, Mahiro...

260
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,950
What's going on?

261
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,950
She mentioned it, too...

262
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,820
It's magic.

263
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,330
The family that's using it has this moronic ambition...

264
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,520
In order to gain greater power,

265
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,360
they're trying to awaken something

266
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,030
that must never be awakened.

267
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:40,670
Return, return, return, return, return.

268
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:48,550
Return, return, return, return, return.

269
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,720
Return, return, return, return, return.

270
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,070
The black iron syndrome is simply a harbinger.

271
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,330
Once it awakens, Japan—

272
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,510
no, the entire world'll be turned upside-down.

273
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,360
<i>This doesn't feel right...</i>

274
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,730
<i>Feels like I'm in a strange dream, listening to Mahiro speak...</i>

275
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,740
Only one person is capable of stopping those idiots.

276
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,010
The family heiress and the most powerful mage known to man,

277
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,020
Kusaribe Hakaze.

278
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,340
<i>Yet for some reason,</i>

279
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,250
<i>I believe every word...</i>

280
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,210
The most powerful?

281
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,900
Then are you that mage's apprentice or something?

282
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,050
Apprentice?

283
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,260
Well, I'm helping her out.

284
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,600
<i>Hey, Mahiro...</i>

285
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,410
<i>This is a fair trade.</i>

286
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,520
<i>You have no right to imply that I owe you any favors.</i>

287
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
You say that now, Hakaze,

288
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,970
but you're the one in trouble without me...

289
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,130
Oh?

290
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,600
So you're saying you don't need me

291
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,990
to locate your sister's killer anymore?

292
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,110
Hey, where did you get that doll?

293
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,480
Is someone else there?

294
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,800
Yeah, he's—

295
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,380
It's coming again. From the sea this time.

296
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,260
Got it.

297
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,510
Tell me its exact origin.

298
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,700
Mahiro!

299
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,790
One month ago,

300
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,520
I found a glass bottle washed up on the beach.

301
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,970
Inside was the doll and a piece of wood.

302
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,600
A message was written on it.

303
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,200
"If you believe in magic

304
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,320
and would trade your soul to have one wish granted,

305
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,330
hammer a nail into this doll."

306
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,670
Even though this island is concealed,

307
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,090
the ocean is still connected to the rest of the world.

308
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,750
The communication method used by oceanographers and castaways...

309
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,000
A message in a bottle.

310
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,300
Even on a deserted island, I can find a bottle among the driftwood.

311
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,950
Once I cast my message out to sea,

312
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,060
I just had to hope the right person would find it.

313
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,020
Guess I have some good luck, after all.

314
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,760
Samon,

315
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,900
even in my underwear, I'm still pretty tough.

316
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,250
With that, I was able to communicate with the mage on an isolated island.

317
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,570
And then we made a deal.

318
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,040
So that's who that was...

319
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,640
In exchange for my help,

320
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,040
I told her to use her magic to find Aika's killer.

321
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,440
Aika's murder made no sense.

322
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,150
Magic doesn't make sense, either.

323
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,250
Maybe two wrongs do make a right.

324
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,220
I will kill Aika's murderer with my own hands.

325
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,180
<i>I believe it...</i>

326
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,070
<i>But...</i>

327
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,670
By the way,

328
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,130
your parents are working in the next city over, right?

329
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,320
They should be safe, then.

330
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,520
Huh? Y-Yeah...

331
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,130
Is your girlfriend okay?

332
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,960
Yeah...

333
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,950
She isn't here.

334
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,510
All right.

335
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,170
How did you know that I was seeing someone?

336
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,170
Oh, someone mentioned it.

337
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,390
<i>This is crazy...</i>

338
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,430
Look, Yoshino...

339
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,040
That's a part of what we're trying to stop!

340
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,650
Return, return, return, return.

341
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,080
Return, return, return, return.
Return, divided fruit!

342
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:45,970
Greatest of all trees, which raises itself above all others...

343
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,830
Greatest of all trees, which raises itself above all others...
Return, return, return, return, return.

344
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,080
Return, return, return, return, return.
Return to your beautiful Tree of Exodus!

345
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:58,050
Beautiful, beautiful. Fruit, fruit. Beautiful...

346
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,880
What the...

347
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,770
When did the whole world go insane, exactly?

348
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,860
I don't care if this world crumbles to ashes.

349
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,860
However, Yoshino...

350
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,700
I'll save it anyway!

351
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,350
The time...

352
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,680
The time is out of joint.

353
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,590
<i>He's just a con artist pretending to be a nice guy.</i>

354
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,060
<i>The kind of guy who could lie with a straight face.</i>

355
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,680
That's harsh.

356
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,310
And I'm a liar, too.

357
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,130
<b>Messages Received</b>

me up again, I'll never forgive you.</b>

358
